Refactoring Plan                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                
1. Import Alias Inconsistency                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                
- Issue: Multiple files use Card as CardType import alias (CardComponent.tsx:1, CardsList.tsx:2, ActivityPage.tsx:12)                                           
- Action: Remove the alias since there's no naming conflict anymore - just use Card                                                                             
- Impact: Cleaner, more straightforward imports                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                
2. Redundant Component Wrapping                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                
- Issue: CardsList component (CardsList.tsx:26-27) wraps each card in both Card and CardComponent                                                               
- Action: Consider consolidating these or clarifying their distinct responsibilities                                                                            
- Impact: Potentially simpler component hierarchy                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                
3. Unused Code Cleanup                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                
- Issue: Form creation logic in CardCreationModal has conditional type handling that's no longer needed                                                         
- Action: Clean up any remaining conditional logic related to card types                                                                                        
- Impact: Simpler, more maintainable code
