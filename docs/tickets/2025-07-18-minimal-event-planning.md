# Minimal Event Planning

## Goal

Add minimal event planning functionality to the Travel Cards application, allowing users to organize and plan simple events or activities.

## User flows

- [Create activity](../flows/create-activity.md)
- [Create Card - Link](../flows/create-card-link.md)
- [Create Card - Poll](../flows/create-card-poll.md)
- [Vote on poll card](../flows/vote-on-poll-card.md)

## Bugs

- Redirect after login: After login, user should be redirected to the original URL they clicked, not the home page
